      Lately I have gotten back into biking and am working on transforming my bike from a flat bar into a drop bar. Turns out this simple conversion 
      requires the replacement of alot of components and it is often recommended to instead simply purchase a new bike. <strong>However</strong>, rather than get this discouraged this
      led me down a rabbit hole of buying lots of parts and researching bike geometry. One of the interesting things I discovered was that bikes use a quite anticuated sizing system that <strong>often</strong>
      leaves puts the avarage person in unrealistic positions that

        <strong>only</strong> really works for the build of <strong>professional</strong> cyclists
      </a> 
      and the sizing scale often leans too big.
